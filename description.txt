In the same folder you will find the design of an iOS app intended to conduct a poll of
musical instruments. 
Design and implement the REST API this app will use, including 
authentication. 
You are free to use any framework and tools you like.
You are free to use any storage engine you prefer. Implement at least basic caching.
Keep in mind, that no frontÂ­end work is needed.
Provide a testing file for the API (Postman/Paw/curl command/unit tests).

What's to see: 
Generally files in:
-web/protected/controllers/
-web/protected/models
-web/protected/config
Testing Postman file in web/protected/data folder

Notes:
-Some things, e.g validation key cache generation e.t.c ,made as not really complex because it's tech task.
-Controller in fact must be as parent controller for other rest entities. But in this test-project it's only one whole.
-Authorization made via sending just user name on headers - like on design.
 I didn't provide full authorization system with tokens as they really don't need
-APC cache used. 
Framework can be obtained via composer
Developed according to rest standards:
-http statuses
-http methods
